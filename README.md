## PitchUp Flutter Sample - Guitar tuning app

This app is a sample Flutter Guitar tuning app which demonstrates how to use 2 different dart libraries to implement a guitar tuning app. It also uses a library called flutter_audio_capture to capture an audio sample. 

The libraries used are: 

- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitchup_dart: Dart library to check if a pitch is in tune for a given instrument.
- https://github.com/techpotatoes/pitch_detector_dart: Dart library to detect a pitch for a given audio sample.

## Usage

```dart

audioSample = .... //See main.dart if you want to learn how to capture audio.

//Step 1
//Create a new pitch detector and set the sample rate and buffer size  
final pitchDetectorDart = PitchDetector(44100, 2000);

//Step 2
//Call the get pitch method passing as a parameter the audio sample (List<double>) to detect a pitch 
final result = pitchDetectorDart.getPitch(audioSample);

if (result.pitched) { //There is a pitch of some sort 

    //Step 3
    //Create a PitchHandler and choose the instrument type
    final pitchUp = PitchHandler(InstrumentType.guitar);

    //Step 4
    //Uses the pitchUp library to check if a a given pitch consists of a guitar note and if it's tuned 
    final handledPitchResult = pitchUp.handlePitch(pitch);

    //Step 5 
    //Change the UI accordingly to the tuning status
    setState(() {
        note = handledPitchResult.note;
        status = handledPitchResult.tuningStatus.toString();
        ...
    })
}
```
